    "## Gradient Descent\n",

    "The problem with the methods we've look at thus far is that they all require inverting the Hessian matrix. This can be very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simpler approach that will only use the gradient, and not the Hessian. Consider $\\nabla E(\\hat\\theta_{i, 0}, \\hat\\theta_{i, 1})$. This is the vector of partial derivatives. Let's consider a change $(\\Delta \\hat\\theta_0, \\Delta \\hat\\theta_1)$. Then, using the tangent line approximation to the quadratic surface, we should have:\n",

    "\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is only an approximation to $\\Delta E$, because the error surface is quadratic, not linear. Therefore, as we change $\\hat\\theta_0, \\hat\\theta_1$, the partial derivatives will change. Still, just like $f'(x)$ is the slope of the line tangent to $f$ at $x$, $\\nabla E(\\hat\\theta)$ is the gradient of the linear surface tangent to $E$ at $\\hat\\theta$. (I wrote $\\hat\\theta$ which is the vector version of $(\\hat\\theta_0, \\hat\\theta_1)$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $\\nabla E(\\theta)$ gives us the best linear approximation to the quadratic surface. For small $\\Delta\\theta$ the approximation should stay pretty good."

    "Now, remember what we want to do: we want to find a minimum of the error surface $E$. But instead of trying to make a big jump to try to zero the partial derivatives, why don't we just try to make a small step in the downhill direction of the quadratic surface?\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, any update $\\Delta\\theta$ where we have $\\nabla E(\\theta) \\cdot \\Delta\\theta < 0$ should reduce the error, provided $\\Delta\\theta$ is small enough that the approximation to $\\Delta E$ is still good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to focus on small $\\Delta\\theta$, let's consider taking a step of length $\\epsilon$. The length of a vector $v$ is given by $\\sqrt{\\sum_i v_i^2}$. This is sometimes called the *Euclidean distance*, or even more commonly the *norm* of $v$. It is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. We write the norm of a vector as $||v||$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write $\\alpha v$, where $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (a real number) and $v \\in \\mathbb{R^n}$ (an $n$-dimensional vector of real numbers), we mean multiplying every component of $v_i$ by $\\alpha$ to produce $\\alpha v = (\\alpha v_1, \\alpha v_2, \\ldots, \\alpha v_n)$. A one-dimensional number like $\\alpha$ is called a *scalar*; stretching/shrinking a vector by multiplying each coordinate by a scalar is called *scalar multiplication*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may verify that $||\\alpha v|| = \\alpha ||v||$. So considering all vectors of length $\\epsilon$ means consider every vector which can be written as $\\epsilon u$, where $||u|| = 1$. A vector where $||u|| = 1$ is called a *unit* vector and a unit vector is often used when we want to focus on *direction* more than length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when picking an update $\\Delta\\theta$, I want to seperate the questions of the *magnitude* of the update ($||\\Delta\\theta||$) and the *direction* of the update. So let's focus on the direction first."

    "So what direction $u$ should we move in? Well, first note that any direction where $\\nabla E(\\theta) \\cdot u > 0$ is heading *uphill* on the error surface. That's because\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[\n",
    "\\nabla E(\\theta) \\cdot u = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\theta_i}(\\theta) u_i\n",
    "\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because an update in the direction of $u$ is effectively a *linear combination* (a \"weighted sum\") of updates along each coordinate dimension $\\theta_i$, each of which impacts $E(\\theta)$ via the slope $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial \\theta_i}(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, $\\nabla E(\\theta) \\cdot u = 0$ means you are traveling sideways on the error surface. A $u$ like this is *parallel to the contour* at $\\theta$. That's because when you're on a contour line, if you move along that line, you don't change your height. Since moving in the direction $u$ doesn't change your height, it must be the direction of the contour line.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we know we want $\\nabla E(\\theta) \\cdot u < 0$. In fact, the best direction $u$ would be the one where $\\nabla E(\\theta) \\cdot u$ is minimized and is as negative as possible. That would be the direction *most* downhill, and would give us the most \"bang for our buck\" with a small move $\\epsilon$."
